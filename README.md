Built with Ruby on Rails 6.1.3

BikeFacts is A Rails app that allows potential bicycle buyers to learn about the maintenance history for bicycles, similar to a Carfax report.

In this beta version, you can create an account and log bicycles that will be associated with your account. For each of these bikes, you are able to maintain records of maintence that you have performed on these bikes. 

It is a good way to keep track of tasks and expenses that you have performed, or had someone perform, on your bikes. 

In future versions, I will include accident reporting for major events that may have comprimised the shape of the bicycle.

I also plan to include a serial-number database where you can look up records by the bike serial number, instead of manually through the bike's show page.
